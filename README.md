**collectAR** is a furniture-based e-commerce mobile application that leverages Augmented Reality (AR) technology to enhance the shopping experience for customers. By utilizing AR, customers can view each product in a realistic and immersive way, reducing uncertainty and increasing confidence in their purchasing decisions.

# Features
**AR Product Visualization:** With collectAR, customers can browse through a diverse catalogue of furniture products within the mobile app. By leveraging the device's camera, the app overlays 3D computer-generated images of the selected products onto the user's physical space. This allows customers to visualize how the furniture would look and fit in their own environment.

**Customizable Room Collections:** collectAR goes beyond traditional e-commerce platforms by empowering customers to create and customize collections of rooms. Users can design virtual rooms and place selected furniture items within them. This feature enables customers to plan and visualize their ideal living spaces, ensuring that the selected furniture aligns with their personal style and preferences.

**Seamless Purchase Experience:** Beside the AR visualization and room customization features, collectAR provides a seamless purchasing process. Once customers have made their selections, they can proceed to make purchases directly within the app. This eliminates the need to switch between multiple platforms, streamlining the buying journey and enhancing convenience.

# Technologies Used
**Flutter:** The front-end of the collectAR online store was developed using Flutter, a versatile software development kit. Flutter enables cross-platform compatibility, allowing for the creation of a consistent and user-friendly mobile application across both Android and iOS devices.

**ARCore Development Kit:** ARCore, a development kit provided by Google, was utilized to deliver AR visual feedback and accurate placement of virtual furniture within the physical environment.

**Firebase:** Firebase, a robust NoSQL database server, was employed as the backend solution for collectAR. It provides secure and scalable storage capabilities, ensuring the seamless retrieval and management of product data, user profiles, and purchase transactions.
